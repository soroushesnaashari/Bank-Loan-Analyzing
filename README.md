### Project Overview

This project tackles the crucial task of predicting loan defaults in the banking sector. It analyzes customer data to build predictive models using:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

By comparing the performance of these models, the project aims to find the most effective solution for loan default prediction.

### Dataset

The dataset contains various customer attributes, such as:

- Age
- Income
- Loan Amount
- Credit Score
- Employment Status
- And more...

You can find the dataset and project notebook on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/soroushesnaashari/bank-loan-logistic-regression-naive-bayes-knn).

### Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize features for better model performance.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Train and test **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, and **KNN** models.
   - Use hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Compare results to determine the best-performing model.

4. **Insights:**
   - Analyze feature importance and their impact on loan prediction.
